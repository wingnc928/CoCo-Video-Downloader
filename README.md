## Prerequisites & Installation (一键快速安装部署)

This project requires **Python 3.8+ (Python 3.10+ recommended)** and external tools (`yt-dlp`, `FFmpeg`, `Deno`). 

We provide a **One-Click Setup Script** (`Init_Setup.bat`) that automatically handles all dependency verification, python package installations, and downloads missing executable binaries for you.

### Step 1: Install Python (If not already installed)
1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download **Python 3.10+**.
2. Run the installer, and **MUST check "Add Python to PATH"** at the bottom of the installation window. This is critical for scripts to run.
3. Click **Install Now** to finish.

### Step 2: Run the One-Click Setup Script
1. Double-click the **`Init_Setup.bat`** file in the project root directory.
2. The script will:
   - Check if Python is installed and configured in PATH.
   - Run `pip install` to install Flask, Flask-CORS, and psutil dependencies.
   - Verify if `yt-dlp.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe` (including `ffprobe.exe`, `ffplay.exe`), and `deno.exe` are available globally on your system.
   - If a binary is missing globally, the script checks if it exists locally in the `backend/` folder.
   - If a binary is missing from both system PATH and local `backend/` folder, the script **automatically downloads the correct version and installs it into the `backend/` folder**!
   
> **Manual Installation alternative**:
> If you prefer manual setups, you can download the binaries yourself and place them inside the `backend/` folder:
> - **yt-dlp.exe**: Download from [yt-dlp releases](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest)
> - **ffmpeg.exe / ffprobe.exe / ffplay.exe**: Download from [gyan.dev essentials](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
> - **deno.exe** (used for YouTube speedup): Download from [Deno releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases)

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Start the Backend Server

**Option A — Auto-start forever (Recommended):**
```bash
Double-click: Add_to_Startup.bat
```
- Server runs silently in background on every Windows boot
- No black CMD window ever appears
- You never have to think about it again

**Option B — Manual start each time:**
```bash
Double-click: Start_Server.bat
```
- A black CMD window stays open — keep it open while browsing
- Close it when you are done downloading

**Option C — Silent manual start:**
```bash
Double-click: Start_Background.bat
```
- Starts the server with NO visible window
- Uses `pythonw.exe` if available

### 2. Install the Browser Extension

1. Open Chrome/Edge/Brave and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn ON **"Developer mode"** (toggle at top-right)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this repo
5. Pin the extension to your toolbar: click the puzzle icon (&#129513;) → **Pin** YT-DLP Downloader

### 3. Download Any Video

1. Go to any website with a video
2. Click the **YT-DLP** icon (&#11015;) in your toolbar
3. Select format: **Best / 1080p / 720p / MP3**
4. Click **Download Video**
5. Watch the live progress bar in the popup
6. File saves automatically to your chosen folder

> **Tip:** You can close the popup while downloading. The server runs in the background. Re-open the popup anytime to check progress.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Extension says **"Server offline"** | Run `Start_Server.bat` or `Add_to_Startup.bat`. Keep the window open. |
| **"yt-dlp not found"** error | Download [yt-dlp.exe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest) and place it in your Downloads folder. Or install via `python -m pip install yt-dlp`. |
| **"Python not found"** error | Reinstall Python and **check "Add to PATH"**. See [Prerequisites Setup](#1-install-python). |
| **"Flask not found"** error | The batch file auto-installs it. If it fails, run `python -m pip install flask flask-cors` manually. |
| Download fails on a specific site | Some sites require cookies or have DRM protection. Check [yt-dlp docs](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki) for that site. |
| Extension won't install | Make sure you selected the `extension/` **folder**, not individual files. |
| Server crashes on startup | Run `Check_Server.bat` to diagnose. It checks Python, Flask, yt-dlp, and server status. |
| Check_Server.bat closes instantly | This means Python is not in PATH. Follow [Prerequisites Setup](#1-install-python). |

## How to Stop / Remove

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Stop server temporarily | Open Task Manager → Details → find `python.exe` or `pythonw.exe` → End Task |
| Stop via batch | Double-click `Stop_Server.bat` |
| Remove auto-start | Double-click `Remove_from_Startup.bat` |
| Uninstall extension | Go to `chrome://extensions/` → find YT-DLP → click **Remove** |

## Advanced Settings

Click **&#9881; Advanced Settings** in the extension popup to configure:

- **Download directory** — Default is your Windows `Downloads` folder. Change to any folder (e.g., `D:\\Videos\\YT-DLP`).
- **Default format** — Pre-select your preferred quality so you don't have to change it every time.

Settings are saved to `backend/settings.json`.

                                                    |
                                                    v
                                        Updates progress bar in popup
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                        Video file saved to chosen directory
```

Everything stays **local** — no data leaves your computer. The server only communicates with your own browser on `127.0.0.1`.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to start the server every time I want to download?**
A: No! Run `Add_to_Startup.bat` once. The server auto-starts silently every time Windows boots.

**Q: Can I close the browser popup while downloading?**
A: Yes! The download runs in the Python server background. Re-open the popup anytime to check progress.

**Q: Is this safe? I see python.exe running in Task Manager.**
A: Yes, that's your local server. It only runs when you started it and only talks to your own browser.

**Q: Does it work on Mac or Linux?**
A: Currently Windows only (batch scripts). Mac/Linux support is on the roadmap — contributions welcome!

**Q: Can I download playlists?**
A: Currently single videos only. Playlist support is planned for a future update.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Areas to improve:

- **Firefox support** — adapt manifest and popup for Firefox
- **macOS / Linux compatibility** — shell scripts instead of batch files
- **Playlist auto-detection** — detect playlists and list all videos
- **Thumbnail previews** — show video thumbnail before downloading
- **Download history** — keep a log of downloaded videos
- **Single EXE version** — package everything with PyInstaller
